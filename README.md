# VB.NET IRC Client

An old project from 2013(? Unsure of date, can be 2012), for high school "software programming" class. 

shoutouts to Mr. uhhhhhhh, I forgot your name but you were probably the reason why I might have gone back to enjoying coding, so cheers.

## How does it work?

Good question, I barely remember how it works, but luckily 2013 me decided to note down all the commands as so:

- JOIN - allows you to join channels (like /join #quake)
- QUIT - disconnect from all servers on the client (not exactly sure, poorly worded)
- CONNECT - join an irc server (defaults to rizon.net)
- PRIVMSG - sends a message to a channel you are in, or to a specific person 
- NICK - change your nickname

## Why are you uploading this

So I can stop saying I made an IRC client in vb.net and actually link this repository to show that I did make one.
